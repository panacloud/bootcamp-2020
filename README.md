### Bootcamp 2020 Project 4A: Red Queen's Race with Web Animation API and React Hooks

[Project Submit Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAj_NogliczLma_YvlE9r1FbBhamiq6dhJy77SIpbxZPYmvw/viewform)


Review the [code and demo](https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNGGaV) and improve and build your own Red Queens Race Animation with React Hooks.

Note the following:

1. When Alice drinks from the bottle, she grows smaller. 
2. Because small children tire out easily, unlike automaton chess pieces, Alice is constantly slowing down.
3. But urging them on by clicking or tapping causes them to speed up.
4. The background elements also have playback rates that are impacted when you click or tap.

"Our eyes are hardwired to notice movement. Historically, it’s helped to keep us alive. And, in 2020, web designers are capitalizing on this default human setting.
Animated illustrations are one of the newest trends being used to direct viewer attention within web designs.  You’ll see these petite animations on sites all over the web.
Some animated illustrations are merely still graphics that jiggle, while other illustrated animations are more thoughtful and complex. When used to their fullest capacity, animated illustrations can tell stories, explain concepts, or help viewers navigate a website."

[20 Extraordinary Web Design Ideas That Will Get Everyone Clicking](https://www.jeffbullas.com/web-design-ideas/)
Incorporating illustration on a website has been a trend for a few years. However, designers are now focusing to create custom and 3D illustrations to define a brand.
An illustration can empower a brand if blended well with minimalism. See how the brand Neat has rightly executed this trend:

[Neat Website](https://thisisneat.com.au/)

To intrigue viewers, brands like Pitch have introduced 3D illustration design:

In this project you will build a animated React Website, all animations must use the latest Web Animations API and latest trends.

Mirage Notes:

1. Mirage runs in the browser, so there's no new terminal processes to manage
2. Returning data from Mirage is as fast and easy as writing frontend code
3. You never alter your application code to consume data from Mirage – your app thinks it's talking to a real network

### Bootcamp 2020 Project 9B: Building Diaries App using React and Redux Toolkit with TypeScript
In this project we will be learning to use Redux by building an app that lets users create and manage diaries. We will be building our application using React, and we’ll set up Mirage as our API mocking server since we have not yet learned to build API's.

[We will follow this Tutorial: Setting Up Redux For Use In A Real-World Application](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/redux-real-world-application/)

[Partial implementation, of only login and signup with react, redux and mirage by Zeeshan](https://github.com/zeeshanhanif/diaries-app-partial)

Note: In the project React Router v5 is being used we recommend that you use v6 in your project.

This Project is very important because up to now we have been doing small projects which focused on only focused limited functionality. Project 9B is the first real-world professional project. In the real-world, we will be doing these kinds of projects. Therefore, give special attention to it.

We want GitHub Actions workflow that builds a static blog site and deploys on Surge. Our content is hosted on Contentful. We would like to rebuild my static site on a normal repository push event, and also via the Contentful webhook whenever our content is updated. [Reference 1](https://github.community/t/is-it-possible-to-trigger-a-single-workflow-in-github-actions-from-two-different-events/16120) [Reference 2](https://medium.com/@flawyte/zeit-now-github-action-contentful-webhook-6a697d2053cd)

Important Challenge Requirement:
We want you to build this blog site with gated content, available only for logged-in users. However we still want the blogs to be indexed for SEO reasons, and would like visitors (not logged in) have access to 3 free blogs (just like Medium), after that we want to user to get a "limited" access to each page (maybe 20 lines or so), just like news website sometimes do. The logged-in users will have unlimited access to all the blogs. We will use [Firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for user logins.

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BUILD A GATSBY WEBSITE?

It depends on the complexity of implementation. If it’s just a development of a simple static web page, then you may pay around 4k - 8k for it.
If you would like to also plan a UX, UI, and Design it, be ready to spend around 6k - 30k - depending on how big the project will be.
If it’s a big and much more complex page, the cost can be around 20k-80k

### Get AWS and Google Cloud Accounts for Bootcamp 2020
The software industry has completely shifted toward multi-cloud usage in projects. In our bootcamp we will be using Amazon and Google clouds extensively. It is requested from all participants that they make arrangements to get the following free AWS and Google accounts within one month:

[AWS Free Offer](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

[Google Cloud Free Offer](https://cloud.google.com/free)

You will get temporary free Access to Google Cloud while doing these [Hello Cloud Run tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/5162?parent=catalog) and [Build a Resilient, Asynchronous System with Cloud Run and Pub/Sub tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/8389?parent=catalog). 

You will get temporary free Access to AWS while doing these [Introduction to AWS Lambda tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10541?parent=catalog) and [Building Serverless Applications with an Event-Driven Architecture](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10959?parent=catalog)

Note 1: It is very easy the difficult part is getting your account verified by using credit cards or bank accounts. 

Note 2: The cloud accounts are not required immediately. We will need them in about a months time.
