### Bootcamp 2020 Project 4A: Red Queen's Race with Web Animation API and React Hooks

[Project Submit Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAj_NogliczLma_YvlE9r1FbBhamiq6dhJy77SIpbxZPYmvw/viewform)


Review the [code and demo](https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNGGaV) and improve and build your own Red Queens Race Animation with React Hooks.

Note the following:

1. When Alice drinks from the bottle, she grows smaller. 
2. Because small children tire out easily, unlike automaton chess pieces, Alice is constantly slowing down.
3. But urging them on by clicking or tapping causes them to speed up.
4. The background elements also have playback rates that are impacted when you click or tap.

"Our eyes are hardwired to notice movement. Historically, it’s helped to keep us alive. And, in 2020, web designers are capitalizing on this default human setting.
Animated illustrations are one of the newest trends being used to direct viewer attention within web designs.  You’ll see these petite animations on sites all over the web.
Some animated illustrations are merely still graphics that jiggle, while other illustrated animations are more thoughtful and complex. When used to their fullest capacity, animated illustrations can tell stories, explain concepts, or help viewers navigate a website."

[20 Extraordinary Web Design Ideas That Will Get Everyone Clicking](https://www.jeffbullas.com/web-design-ideas/)
Incorporating illustration on a website has been a trend for a few years. However, designers are now focusing to create custom and 3D illustrations to define a brand.
An illustration can empower a brand if blended well with minimalism. See how the brand Neat has rightly executed this trend:

[Neat Website](https://thisisneat.com.au/)

To intrigue viewers, brands like Pitch have introduced 3D illustration design:

In this project you will build a animated React Website, all animations must use the latest Web Animations API and latest trends.

### Get AWS and Google Cloud Accounts for Bootcamp 2020
The software industry has completely shifted toward multi-cloud usage in projects. In our bootcamp we will be using Amazon and Google clouds extensively. It is requested from all participants that they make arrangements to get the following free AWS and Google accounts within one month:

[AWS Free Offer](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

[Google Cloud Free Offer](https://cloud.google.com/free)

You will get temporary free Access to Google Cloud while doing these [Hello Cloud Run tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/5162?parent=catalog) and [Build a Resilient, Asynchronous System with Cloud Run and Pub/Sub tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/8389?parent=catalog). 

You will get temporary free Access to AWS while doing these [Introduction to AWS Lambda tutorial](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10541?parent=catalog) and [Building Serverless Applications with an Event-Driven Architecture](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10959?parent=catalog)

Note 1: It is very easy the difficult part is getting your account verified by using credit cards or bank accounts. 

Note 2: The cloud accounts are not required immediately. We will need them in about a months time.
